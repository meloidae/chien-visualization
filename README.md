# chien-visualization
Visualize subway train delays in Tokyo area.
Data coordinates for stations are taken from [this page](https://webdrawer.net/sample/train/train.html).
Used [JQuery subwayMap plugin](https://github.com/techbubble/subwayMap) for train map visualization, but replaced all canvas rendering with svg using [SVG.js](https://svgjs.com/) to make map components interactable.
